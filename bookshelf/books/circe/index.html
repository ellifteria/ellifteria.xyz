<p>Some books you read because they have excellent characters. Others have captivating plots, others expansive worlds, others momentous themes. And others still esoteric and profound ideas -- more on this last section in a few posts.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend reading <em>Circe</em> for any of those reasons; although it definitely has all of them, save the profound ideas. No. I would recommend <em>Circe</em> because it of its alluring and beautiful storytelling and writing.</p>
<p><em>Circe</em> is a feminist retelling of the Ancient Greek myth of Circe. It is an engaging story that humanizes a character that was treated as little more than an object or a caricature in the original tale. It is powerful in showing the harms of treating others as nothing more than tools and not even human.</p>
<p>And the writing is phenomenal. The story is told in such an incredible way that reading the book feels nothing short of luxurious. The words flow effortlessly like a river and you float opulently along them, ensnared by their grasp. You see and feel Circe's story intimately throughout this novel. It is an incredible novel that touches on the different roles and levels of respect society gives to men and women and the estrangement those who don't conform to society's expectations feel. It is absolutely worth a read.</p>
<p>That being said a content warning is necessary since, given the subject matter, rape does play a pivotal role in the novel. It is told in the first person but it is not especially graphic. Fundamentally, it does play an integral part of Circe's myth and so it is present.</p>
<p>In summary, phenomenal book and 100% worth a read. 8.5/10.</p>
