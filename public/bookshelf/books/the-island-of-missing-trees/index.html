<p>Overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranking: 8.5/10 Very engaging, very well-written, very touching. Overall, excellent book</li>
<li>Read: 2022 Summer</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We are starting off with an incredible book this time. If you're going to only read one of the 17 books I read this summer, it should be this one, hands down.</p>
<p><em>The Island of Missing Trees</em> is the second in my &quot;Refugee Trilogy&quot; (see also <a href="../a-long-petal-of-the-sea"><em>A Long Petal of the Sea</em></a> and <a href="../the-beekeeper-of-aleppo"><em>The Beekeeper of Aleppo</em></a>). It is the story of a Cypriot family who built a new life for themselves after leaving Cypriot following the war there between the island's Greek and Turkish populations. This book is touching, it is a poignant exploration of being separated from one's homeland and of the death and destruction brought about by warfare. It is a chilling reminder of how much damage we do to ourselves and to the world when we commit acts of violence against one another. But it is also a beautiful story of how humanity can bridge those differences and come together after conflict.</p>
<p>Do not expect a happy, fairytale plot though. The book details the very human psychological damage that living through and trying to rebuild after conflict brings.</p>
<p>Finally, this book has a very interesting point of view for many of its chapters. I won't spoil anything but the point of view is delightfully non-human and a joy to read.</p>
<p><em>The Island of Missing Trees</em> is an emotional, beautifully written masterpiece that should be on everyone's &quot;to be read&quot; list. 8.5/10.</p>
