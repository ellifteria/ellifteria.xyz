We are starting off with an incredible book this time. If you're going to only read one of the 17 books I read this summer, it should be this one, hands down.

*The Island of Missing Trees* is the second in my "Refugee Trilogy" (see also [*A Long Petal of the Sea*](../a-long-petal-of-the-sea) and [*The Beekeeper of Aleppo*](../the-beekeeper-of-aleppo)). It is the story of a Cypriot family who built a new life for themselves after leaving Cypriot following the war there between the island's Greek and Turkish populations. This book is touching, it is a poignant exploration of being separated from one's homeland and of the death and destruction brought about by warfare. It is a chilling reminder of how much damage we do to ourselves and to the world when we commit acts of violence against one another. But it is also a beautiful story of how humanity can bridge those differences and come together after conflict.

Do not expect a happy, fairytale plot though. The book details the very human psychological damage that living through and trying to rebuild after conflict brings.

Finally, this book has a very interesting point of view for many of its chapters. I won't spoil anything but the point of view is delightfully non-human and a joy to read.

*The Island of Missing Trees* is an emotional, beautifully written masterpiece that should be on everyone's "to be read" list. 8.5/10.
