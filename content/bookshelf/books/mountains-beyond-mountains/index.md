*Mountains Beyond Mountains* details the life of Dr. Paul Farmer, a medical anthropologist who started Partners in Health, an organization bringing medical aid to people in the developing world.

Dr. Farmer's story is incredible and should be an inspiration to anyone seeking a career in international or public health. However, I simply did not like the author's style in the book. The smug attitude he took to scenes that included himself really distracted me from the subject, Dr. Farmer, and made it difficult to read.

Overall, great content, you should definitely read up on Dr. Farmer's life and deeds. However, I don't know if this book is the way to do it, at least for my reading tastes. 3.5/10.
