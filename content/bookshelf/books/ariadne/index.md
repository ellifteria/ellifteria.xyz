Overview:

- Ranking: 7/10 Great retelling of an Ancient Greek myth; suffers from being read after [*Circe*](../circe)
- Read: 2022 Summer

---

This book is another excellent retelling of an Ancient Greek myth. It was a joy to read; however, it comes with the same general content warning that came with *Circe*. Unfortunately, most Ancient Greek myths are not exactly free from violence, misogyny, and rape.

If all I've said so far has been praise for *Ariadne*, why is it rated so much lower than *Circe*? Solely because I read it after *Circe*, and, despite it being a great book, it just wasn't as good as *Circe*.

All in all, it's an enjoyable read; however, it can't stand up to Miller's prose in *Circe*. 7/10.
