Overview

- Read: 2022 Summer

---

*Spillover* by David Quammen is a very good nonfiction book that elucidates the connection between human society and nature and the dangers of zoonotic diseases in an approachable and interesting way. It's definitely an excellent read especially if you're interested in the infectious diseases and pandemics but also for anyone really. The past few years have shown just how important this subject is to the modern world. The book covers a consequential topic and is very well-written.

Being nonfiction, I'm going to give it a 8/10 but keep in mind that that rating is on a different scale than the ratings for the other books I read this summer. And yes, this is the only scientific, nonfiction book I read this summer.
